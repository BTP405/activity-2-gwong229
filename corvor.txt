Wook at them they come to this pwace when they know they awe not puwe
Tenno use the keys but they awe mewe twespassews
Onwy I Vow know the twue powew of the Void
I was cut in hawf destwoyed but thwough it's Janus Key the Void cawwed to me
It bwought me hewe and hewe I was webown
We cannot bwame these cweatuwes they awe being wed by a fawse pwophet an impostow who knows not the secwets of the Void
Behowd the Tenno come to scavenge and desecwate this sacwed weawm
My bwothews did I not teww of this day Did I not pwophesize this moment
Now I wiww stop them Now I am changed webown thwough the enewgy of the Janus Key
Fowevew bound to the Void
Wet it be known if the Tenno want twue sawvation they wiww way down theiw awms and wait fow the baptism of my Janus key
It is time I wiww teach these twespassews the wedemptive powew of my Janus key
They wiww weawn it's simpwe twuth The Tenno awe wost and they wiww wesist
But I Vow wiww cweanse this pwace of theiw impuwity
