Part 1
Approach 1.
Approach 1 creates a function called doubleL which takes a parameter n. It generates a list by taking the range of numbers from 0 to n and multiplying it by two and then adding it to a list and then returning the list. It then calls the function with 5 as the parameter, so it generates 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and replaces the typical newline with " : ", in the print statement printing the line 0 : 2 : 4 : 6 : 8 : .

Approach 2.
This approach uses list comprehension to generate the same list as above, and then prints it the same way.

Approach 3.
This approach makes a function called doubleG which is a generator function that takes a parameter n, and then, in the range 0-n, not including n, generates a list of each element in the range multiplied by 2.


Part 2
doubleG is a generator function, generators are used for large files, generating infinite sequences, pipelines, and "lazy evaluations", which save memory by not creating entire sequences, only representing steps.
